***Chapter 2 - Creating Django Apps***
Starting a new project in Django
    - When creating a new app use this command in the directory the app's folder
      should go -->
        - "django-admin startproject [project_name]
Creating a Django App in a Porject
    - When setting up separate primary pages or functions of a web app, django 
      creates what are called "apps". This creates a folder with the desired name
      and contains all the basic Django elements -->
        - "django-admin startapp [app_name]
Setting up URLs in your Django Project
    - THE FIRST THING to do, is to add a URL pathway inside the "urls.py" module
      for the main project "app" folder
    - This can come in the form of a simple reference to the specific view we'd 
      like to reach given some URL input.
    - In urls.py, add the URL pathway in the "urlpatterns" object already there -->
        - #  urlpatterns = [
          #     path('[url_string]', views.chris, name='[urlshortcut_string]')
          #  ]
    - IF THE VIEW is intended to be a publicly reachable module for a page, edit
      the app's "views.py" file to import Django's HTTP response module -->
        - from [django.http] import [HttpResponse]
