***Chapter 2 - Creating Django Apps***
Starting a new project in Django
    - When creating a new app use this command in the directory the app's folder
      should go -->
        - "django-admin startproject [project_name]
Creating a Django App in a Porject
    - When setting up separate primary pages or functions of a web app, django 
      creates what are called "apps". This creates a folder with the desired name
      and contains all the basic Django elements -->
        - "django-admin startapp [app_name]
Setting up URLs in your Django Project
    - THE FIRST THING to do, is to add a URL pathway inside the "urls.py" module
      for the main project "app" folder
    - This can come in the form of a simple reference to the specific view we'd 
      like to reach given some URL input.
    - In urls.py, add the URL pathway in the "urlpatterns" object already there -->
        - #  urlpatterns = [
          #     path('[url_string]', views.chris, name='[urlshortcut_string]')
          #  ]
    - IF THE VIEW is intended to be a publicly reachable module for a page, edit
      the app's "views.py" file to import Django's HTTP response module -->
        - from [django.http] import [HttpResponse]

***Chapter 3 - Django and Databases***
Creating the Models in Django
    - For any given app that's created, Django creates a "models.py" file. This
      file will contain the classes/data that you intend to store in the database
      and/or output eventually to a webpage.
    - It is best practice to initially create a class representative of the app itself,
      or in other words, create a class named the same thing as the app. -->
        - class [model_name](model.Models)
    - Inside Django models, you can establish properties of that model, i.e., images,
      names, text, values, etc. -->
        - [image_var] = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/')
        - [string_var] = models.CharField(max_length=200)
Postgres Setup for Django
    - Go to the PostgreSQL website and download the Windows version. Go through the
      installation process (the default location should be fine).
    - Three things to look out for -->
        - PostgreSQL SuperUser Password: [last_four_phone_digits]
        - Port Number: Default is [5432]
        - Database Locale: Specify [english_united_states] or something close
    - Using Postgres from the CLI of Windows: After installation, navigate over to
      the system's environment variables. Select "Path", and click "edit". The next
      window should show a variety of paths previously created. Create a "new" path
      and add the path for the "bin" folder of the Postgres installation -->
        - [Example] C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin\
    - Accessing Postgres from the CLI: Once the path is setup, the user can initiate
      postgres by using the command -->
        - "psql -U postgres"
        - NOTE: This will then prompt the user for the superuser password which
          was created during installation. Once entered, the CLI should show something
          like -->
        - [Example]: postgres=#
    - Creating a new Database: Once in the postgres CLI, use the following command,
      followed by the name you'd like to give to the database, followed by a
      semicolon -->
        - CREATE DATABASE [db_name];
    - Viewing the New Database in the Postgres Admin Console: To view the databases 
      on the machine, launch the provided pgAdmin4 application. In the beginning
      there should only be two databases, the default "postgres" database on the newly
      made one called "portfoliodb"
Connecting Postgress to Django
    - Navigate to the DATABASES dictionary in "settings.py". Since we're working 
      with a psotgres database, we must change the engine source -->
        - 'ENGINE': ['django.db.backends.postgresql']
    - Edit the NAME attribute to the name of the database created earlier, i.e.,
      "NAME" should now equal portfoliodb or -->
        - 'NAME': ['portfoliodb']
    - Add new attributes and their associated values -->
        - 'USER': ['postgres']
        - 'PASSWORD': ['****']
        - 'HOST': 'localhost'
        - 'PORT': '5432'
        - **NOTE** Fun fact, localhost:8000 is the same as 127.0.0.1:8000
  FIRST SERVER RUN AFTER EDITING DATABASE ATTRIBUTES
        - There should be an error stating that they cannot load the psycopg2 module.
          To fix this, use the following command -->
          - ['pip3 install psycopg2'] in the local project directory
Making Django Migrations and Migrating
    - Start with the command -->
        - "python manage.py makemigrations"
    - When to run the make migrations command?
        - Whenever a new model is made or changed.
    - What does it do?
        - Creates a migrations folder if it wasn't already present. Next, a new python
          file called something like [0001_initial.py] will show up in that folder.
    - Once that is done, we can finally tell Django to solidify those migrations our
      database. Using the command -->
        - "python manage.py migrate"
    - Everything that needed to be migrated will now be confirmed and added.

Setting up the Admin Panel in Django
    - How to reach the admin console?
        - python manage.py runserver
        - Use the URL: localhost:8000/admin
            - This will prompt a login
    - Creating a SuperUser for the Admin consolde. Use the following command -->
        - "python manage.py createsuperuser"
        - It will ask for a preferred username --> [chris]
        - It will ask for a preferred e-mail --> [blank]
        - It will ask for a preferred password --> [****]
    - While the server is running, you can now login to the admin console using those
      credentials.
